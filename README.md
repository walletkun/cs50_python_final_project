## Video Demo

[Video Demo]https://youtu.be/nTwZKMO0uDA

## Description

The FunctionPlotter is a Python project that allows you to visualize various mathematical functions using data visualization techniques. This tool provides an interactive way to plot functions, explore mathematical concepts, and create graphical representations of equations.

## Features

- Visualize a wide range of mathematical functions, including trigonometric, polynomial, exponential, and more.
- Customize the x-axis range and the number of data points to display.
- Integrated support for Euler's number (e) and trigonometric functions like sine and cosine.
- User-friendly interface for inputting and plotting custom functions.
- Grid lines, axis labels, and title for improved visualization.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Required Python libraries (NumPy and Matplotlib) can be installed using the following command:
pip install numpy matplotlib


### Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the terminal and navigate to the project folder.
3. Run the project by executing the following command:
python project.py


### Usage

1. When prompted, enter a mathematical function in the format: `math.e**x` or `math.sin(x)`.
2. Choose the desired x-axis range and number of data points for the plot.
3. The program will generate a graphical representation of the function, and you can interact with the plot.
